# Development

To get your development environment setup, clone the repo, then follow the steps outlined in the README.md page.

Right now the focus is on testing and fixing any bugs that come up.  In the near future, development of new game contracts and improvements to existing ones will be prioritized.  This will likely be discussed in the project's Discord or in the discussion section for this repo.  That said, anyone is still welcome to play around with the game contracts, extend them, or create new ones.
